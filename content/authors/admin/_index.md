I am currently a Master's student in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University and a graduate researcher in Imaging and Computational Neuroscience Lab (ICON Lab) under the supervision of Prof. Tolga Ã‡ukur. My research studies aim to develop supervised and unsupervised deep learning models for volumetric magnetic resonance image synthesis, reconstruction, and super-resolution, as well as for fundamental computer vision problems including image-to-image translation and image inpainting.

I am also a passionate chess player, and I enjoy playing basketball, tennis, and board games.

[A latest version of my CV is available here in pdf](files/Mahmut_Yurt_CV.pdf)

**Research Description**

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a preferential medical imaging modality extensively exercised in clinical applications to image soft-tissues and nervous systems. The preference for MRI confides in its capacity to acquire high-resolution volumetric images of the same underlying anatomy with a comprehensive set of different tissue contrasts. In an MRI scan, the tissue contrasts are captured by describing specific pulse sequences, and radio frequency signals emitted from tissues are collected in a spatial Frequency domain, called k-space. The signals collected in k-space are then inverse Fourier transformed to produce desired volumetric images of the given anatomy. Yet, prolonged data acquisitions in MRI scans inherently restrict the diversity and quality of the MR images acquired. My research studies therefore aim to **develop fully-supervised and semi-supervised multi-contrast MRI synthesis deep network models** to synthesize a more diverse set of MR images from a less diverse one, and to **develop accelerated MRI reconstruction and super-resolution deep network models** to reconstruct increased quality images from limited-quality ones, as well as to **develop synergistic synthesis-reconstruction deep network models** to jointly recover a comprehensive set of high-quality and diverse images from lower-quality and less-diverse ones.
