I am currently a Master's candidate in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University and a graduate researcher at Imaging and Computational Neuroscience (ICON) Lab under the supervision of Prof. Tolga Ã‡ukur. My research focuses on the **synergistic combination of computer vision and medical imaging to advance healthcare** by developing novel **supervised and unsupervised deep learning models for volumetric multi-contrast accelerated magnetic resonance image synthesis, reconstruction and super-resolution**, as well as for **fundamental computer vision problems** including **image-to-image translation and image inpainting**.




I am also a passionate chess player, and I enjoy playing basketball, tennis, and board games.
