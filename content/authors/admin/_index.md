I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, under the supervision of Prof. John Pauly and Prof. Kawin Setsompop. I received my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees from Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University, where I worked with Prof. Tolga Cukur. My research focuses on the **synergistic combination of computer vision and medical imaging to advance healthcare** by developing novel deep learning models for **accelerated multi-contrast MRI synthesis, reconstruction and super-resolution** as well as for the **foremost computer vision problems** utilizing **supervised and unsupervised learning approaches**.


I am a passionate chess player (please reach me for a series of blitz games). I also enjoy playing basketball, tennis, and board games.
