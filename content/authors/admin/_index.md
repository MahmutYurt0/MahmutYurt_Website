I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof. Salman Avestimehr](https://www.avestimehr.com/vital-lab) at the University of Southern California(USC) Electrical & Computer Engineering Department. My research aims to analyse machine learning systems through the lens of information theory and graph signal processing. During my masters, I was a R&D Engineer at [Turkcell Technology](https://www.avestimehr.com/vital-lab) under the supervision of [Dr. Salih Ergut](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?user=ZNkm_vcAAAAJ&hl=tr) thanks to the 5G & Beyond Graduate Scholarship.
