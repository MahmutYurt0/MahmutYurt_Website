Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a central modality in clinical neuroimaging due to its nonpareil ability to produce high-resolution volumetric images of the same underlying anatomy under a comprehensive set of diverse tissue contrasts. In an MRI scan, the tissue contrasts are captured by manifesting tailored pulse sequences, and the signals from the tissues are collected spatially in a special Frequency domain, namely k-space. The signals collected in the k-space are then inverse Fourier transformed to generate the desired images. However, prolonged data acquisition protocols in MRI undesirably limit the quality and diversity of the MR images collected. The research I pursue therefore aims to investigate **computer vision techniques** to develop novel **fully-supervised and semi-supervised deep learning models** for **accelerated MRI reconstruction and super-resolution** to reconstruct high-quality MR images from limited quality ones, and for **multi-contrast MRI synthesis** to synthesize a more diverse set of MR images from a less diverse one, as well as for **synergistic reconstruction-synthesis** to jointly recover a comprehensive diverse set of high-quality images from a lower-quality and less-diverse one.
