# About

I am currently a Master's student in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University and a graduate researcher in Imaging and Computational Neuroscience Lab (ICON Lab) under the supervision of Prof. Tolga Ã‡ukur. My research studies aim to develop supervised and unsupervised deep learning models for volumetric magnetic resonance image synthesis, reconstruction, and super-resolution, as well as for fundamental computer vision problems including image-to-image translation and image inpainting.
